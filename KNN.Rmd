> We did not log numeric variables to make output easier to interpret however if you remove the g from the above code it does improve model performace slightly. We felt it was not a significant enough improvement to justify the ease of comparing predictions. 

## Split Data into Seasons to test performance by Season.

```{r}
# Spring
Avg4_Sp <- Avg4%>% 
  filter(season == 'Spring')
# Summer
Avg4_Su <- Avg4%>% 
  filter(season == 'Summer')
# Fall
Avg4_F <- Avg4%>% 
  filter(season == 'Fall')
# Winter is coming
Avg4_W <- Avg4%>% 
  filter(season == 'Winter')

# Only 2022
Avg4_2022 <- Avg4%>% 
  filter(CalendarYear == 2022)
```

> We noticed considerably worse performance durring Winter so we decided to look at every season. This is expected as water demand is not driven by Season.

## Split all datasets into Train and test

```{r}
set.seed(6496)

#Avg4

ti <- createDataPartition(Avg4$avg_demand_mgd, p=0.8,
                         list = FALSE)

train <- Avg4[ti,]
test <- Avg4[-ti,]
```

# Model Selection

## Performance Metrics

R2 : Tells us that the predictor variables in the model are able to explain x% of the variation in target variable.

MAE: Is to subtract our predicted value and actual value at each time point to obtain the absolute value, and then average it out.

RMSE: tells us the average deviation between the predicted demand made by the model and the actual demand value.

MAPE: returns error as a percentage, making it easy to understand:
MAPE	Interpretation
' < 10 %	Very good
' 10 % - 20 %	Good
' 20 % - 50 %	OK
' > 50 %	Not good


### K-Nearest Neighbors

```{r}
mod3 <- IBk(avg_demand_mgd ~ ., data = train, control = Weka_control(K = 34, I= TRUE))
```

Valid options are:

 -I
  Weight neighbors by the inverse of their distance
  (use when k > 1)
 -F
  Weight neighbors by 1 - their distance
  (use when k > 1)
 -K <number of neighbors>
  Number of nearest neighbors (k) used in classification.
  (Default = 1)
 -E
  Minimize mean squared error rather than mean absolute
  error when using -X option with numeric prediction.
 -W <window size>
  Maximum number of training instances maintained.
  Training instances are dropped FIFO. (Default = no window)
 -X
  Select the number of nearest neighbors between 1
  and the k value specified using hold-one-out evaluation
  on the training data (use when k > 1)
 -A
  The nearest neighbor search algorithm to use (default: weka.core.neighboursearch.LinearNNSearch).
