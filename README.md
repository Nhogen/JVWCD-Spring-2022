    + This file contains our initial look at the data provided to us by Jordan Valley Water to identify questions and generate ideas.

+ sandbox_1-5.rmd

    + These files are files used by the group to compare models and generate ideas that help improve performance metrics. These files helped us arrive at many of our pre processing decisions.

+ Model_Comparison.rmd and Model_Comparison.html

    + This model shows how we chose the model that we did. What performance metrics we used, and testing for overfitting.
