# JVWCD Spring 2022

This repo is a Capstone project for the MSBA program at the University of Utah. This project was completed for Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District. 

# Business Statement

There is a strong correlation between water usage and weather patterns in the water industry. Water usage increases during warmer and drier periods, and when it’s colder and wetter, water usage is typically less. Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District (JVWCD) has noticed this trend and is wanting to find a solution that will allow them to be more proactive and not so reactive to changes in water demand with these seasonal trends.

Historically, operations staff have worked in a reactive state chasing water demands of community members, which is influenced by changing weather. Most of this variability happens in the summer, with residential outdoor landscape watering being the leading consumer. Roughly 65% of the community’s water use is in that outdoor landscape space. This reactive chase ensures that the community always has water, which often requires water managers, supervisors and operators to spend long hours (including overtime hours), watching and reacting to changes in water demand. Managing the system’s water demand can be like steering a large ship – sudden and abrupt changes are not easily absorbed. Also, there is a cost factor to this. Well-informed planning to operate the system with consistency and minor tweaks saves money. However, operational costs can add up quickly if a well is started at an unplanned time. This event could cost the water system $5,000 to $9,000 in electricity demand charges alone.

# Analytic Objective

JVWCD would like to be more efficient with its resources and manpower. The goal of this capstone project is to explore modeling water demand against weather data. The ideal outcome of this project would be a predictive model that gives the operations team more confidence in making decisions related to water demand so that they can move to a more proactive form of water deliveries.
