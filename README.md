# JVWCD Spring 2022

This repo is a Capstone project for the MSBA program at the University of Utah. This project was completed for Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District.

The easiest way to access the code is to open JVWCD-Spring-2022.Rproj in R studio. This will open an R Project that will have all of the files available to open from R-Studio.

# Models

+ Water Demand Forecast.twb
    + The tableu model with Time Series predictions.
+ KNN.Rmd
    + A file with only the code to pre process data and train the KNN model 
        + Note, in this file numeric variables are logged so output is also logged and must be unlogged to be human readable.
+ LM.Rmd
    + A file with only the code to pre process data and train the LM model

# rmd and HTML files

+ eda.rmd and eda.html

    + This file contains our initial look at the data provided to us by Jordan Valley Water to identify questions and generate ideas.

+ sandbox_1-5.rmd

    + These files are files used by the group to compare models and generate ideas that help improve performance metrics. These files helped us arrive at many of our pre processing decisions.

+ Model_Comparison.rmd and Model_Comparison.html

    + This model shows how we chose the model that we did. What performance metrics we used, and testing for overfitting.

# Presentation

+ JVWCD Slide Deck .pptx

    + Slide deck used to present the model.
